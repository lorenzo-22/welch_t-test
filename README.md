# DDA_welch_ttest
Welch T-test for Omnbibenchmark for project: https://github.com/lorenzo-22/OmniBench-DAA_project

NB! To be changed when the correct data is available: 
- Currently runs dummy data. 
- Currently returns dataframe with no protein name (just idx)

Takes matrixes and returns a csv of feature, t_stat, p_value into --out_dir
